Introduction:
	For the first step of our project we will attempt to make a digital 3D model, from a reproduction of “William” the faience hippopotamus from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Initially we placed one spotlight, but finding it too dark to get accurate pictures, we elected to add another to to counteract any shadowing we could affect Scan 3D’s or Regard 3D’s ability to make a model. We decided to make our first model with Regard 3D because it takes the longest to process so while it is processing, we will continue to take pictures using Scan 3D. To keep human error to a minimum, or at least account for differences in each members photography style, we decided to have one person (Kurt) do one set, and if neither of them are found to make satisfactory we will have the other person (Margaret) to do another set. We will take the best of the first set if they are both satisfactory. 

-On first attempt to create a model, 32 pictures of William from Kurt’s phone camera were uploaded to Regard3D. Unfortunately, due to Regard3D’s inability to read the camera’s focal length, the program failed to produce a model under its standard settings. More work may be attempted on this at a later point.

-The second attempt by Kurt took over 80 pictures of William for a low-quality model on Scan3D. This model seemed to be a fairly accurate representation of William, except for the mouth of the hippopotamus, which was apparently obscured in most pictures and appeared as a vague, jagged surface in the model.

-A third attempt was made by Margaret using Scan3D, this time with 47 pictures of William. Margaret took more pictures of the hippo’s face to see if this would make a difference in the model. Unfortunately, though the face was smoother in the final model, its texture remained inconsistent.
