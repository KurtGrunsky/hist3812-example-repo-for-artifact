### Macro - The Bigger Picture

In our decision to construct a 3D model of "William", the faience hippopotamus originating from Egypt, we must be clear: we are not attempting to construct this model from the "original", but rather from a replica of the statue bought in a gift shop. This will pose a number of interesting implications for consideration.

The original statue is considered to be of some historical importance. In one respect, it seems inevitable that our model will lose some of that "aura" of historical importance, since it is being scanned from an imperfect replica of the original. Thus while the model will hopefully be recognizable to those familiar with William, it will be quite distinct from the original.

From this inherent fracture in the trajectory, we will find ourselves faced with options as to how we are to understand and (re)present the resulting 3D model. We may decide that this model is an "inferior" representation of William, as it is not an "objective" enough depiction.
