	For this particular module, which is based around William’s legs being broken, there was surprisingly little information to be found. From the article that the Metropolitan Museum of Art, they give the facts that William was found with broken legs and that they were probably broken in order to protect the deceased from some sort of harm that a hippopotamus could do. This is only speculation however and cannot be verified. Because our version of William does not have the cracks from which legs were broken and subsequently restored, the official pictures of him had to be consulted in order to determine which legs should be the ones that get broken in the AR model. Based on these pictures, it was determined that his front two legs, as well as his back right leg were the ones that were broken. Unfortunately, this was also unable to be verified by any source, credible or otherwise. The missing texture on the model also posed some problems for our AR because some of the object’s meaning was lost. The aquatic motif that was painted on William held significance for why its legs were broken in the first place as being some sort of powerful force of the Nile, which then needed to be tamed for safe passage for the deceased. This is also based on speculation and would have only added a small amount of context to the audience and that was only if they were to do research into the object like we have.
